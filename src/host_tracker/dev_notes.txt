This directory contains the implementation of the HostTracker components.

* The HostTracker object contains information that is known or discovered
about a host.  It provides an API to get/set host data in a thread-safe
manner.

* The global host_cache is used to cache HostTracker objects so that they
can be shared between threads.

* The HostTrackerModule is used to read in initial known information about
hosts, populate HostTracker objects, and place them in the host_cache.
