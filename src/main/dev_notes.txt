SnortConfig is used heavily throughout the code and should be updated so
that builtin modules can attach state in a generic but readily accessible
fashion.

Re THREAD_LOCAL defined in thread.h:

In clang, this code compiles (std::array has, for all intents and purposes,
a constexpr constructor). gcc, on the other hand has stricter requirements
for constexpr expressions (tested on gcc 4.8, 4.9, and 5) and the code will
not compile.  This article implies that at the very least, the clang
treatment is more up-to-date:

In any case, it does not matter right now, because we are only defining
THREAD_LOCAL -> thread_local on compilers that do not support extern
declarations of variables with the GNU __thread attribute (AKA clang).  In
the future, we may want to consider making the code compatible with either
TLS attribute, independent of the compiler (and of course
__declspec(thread) for windows, whenever we cross that bridge).
