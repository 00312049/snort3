The latency directory contains code for latency logging and management.

* Packet latency: tracks and manages latency in packet processing.
  Packet latency maintains an internal stack of timers for each
  packet processing context. The API can be queried to check if
  a packet should be fastpathed, and upon context exit,
  either an event, a log message or both can be generated
  based on whether the packet was fastpathed and depending on
  how the manager was configured.

* Rule latency: To be ported over from ppm/

Notes:

 * Latency is intended to replace the legacy ppm/ code
