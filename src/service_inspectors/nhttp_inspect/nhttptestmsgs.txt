# A message section is the unit of data passed to the inspector and may by headers, body, a chunk, or trailing headers. 
# Blank lines separate message sections. Extra blank lines don't have any effect.
# Lines beginning with '@' are control commands.
# You cannot put comments or control commands in the middle of a message section.
# If a message section begins with # or @ (presumably a very rare situation) you must escape it: \# or \@
# Control commands:
#    @request or @response sets the message direction. Applies to subsequent sections until changed.
#    @tcpclose specifies that the section ends with a TCP close. Applies only to the very next section.
#    @<decimal number> sets the test number and hence the test output file name. Applies to subsequent sections until changed. Don't reuse numbers.
#    Commands must be all lower case with no white space.
# The escape character is \ and it is used only within message sections.
# \# and \@ are only necessary for the very first character of a message section. \r, \n, \t, \x, \X, and \\ may appear anywhere in a section.
# \x and \X are identical and signify the beginning of an arbitrary two-digit hexadecimal escape value. Examples: 0x3A, 0X27, 0xeE. Case a-f or A-F
# does not matter.
