This directory contains the implementation of the base Stream preprocessor
module.  This module is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and
implements the following capabilities:

* entry point for Stream evaluation of a packet

* stream global configuration management

* stream statistics management.

Each protocol (or packet source) stream supports is implemented as its own
Inspector and the base class delegates the actual evaluation of a packet to
the specific module.
