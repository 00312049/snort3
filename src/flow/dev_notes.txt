Flows are preallocated at startup and stored in protocol specific caches.
FlowKey is used for quick look up in the cache hash table.

Each flow may have associated inspectors:

* clouseau is the Wizard bound to the flow to help determine the
  appropriate service inspector

* gadget is the service inspector

* data is a passive service inspector such as a client config.

FlowData is used by various inspectors to store specific data on the flow
for later use.  Any inspector may store data on the flow, not just clouseau
gadget.

FlowData reference counts the associated inspector so that the inspector
can be freed (via garbage collection) after a reload.

There are many flags that may be set on a flow to indicate session tracking
state, disposition, etc.
