Flows are preallocated at startup and stored in protocol specific caches.
FlowKey is used for quick look up in the cache hash table.

Each flow may have associated inspectors:

* clouseau is the Wizard bound to the flow to help determine the
  appropriate service inspector

* gadget is the service inspector

* data is a passive service inspector such as a client config.

FlowData is used by various inspectors to store specific data on the flow
for later use.  Any inspector may store data on the flow, not just clouseau
gadget.

FlowData reference counts the associated inspector so that the inspector
can be freed (via garbage collection) after a reload.

There are many flags that may be set on a flow to indicate session tracking
state, disposition, etc.

HighAvailability (ha.cc, ha.h) serves to synchronize session state between high
availabity partners.  HighAvailability uses Side Channel Connectors to transmit
and receive messages.  The HA side channel must be full duplex (both a
transmit and receive connector).  The primary purpose is to exchange session
state with the goal of keeping the session caches in sync.  But other clients
may also subscribe to the HA service to exchange additional session data.  Each
client uses the FlowHAClient class to subscribe to the service.

The HA subsystem exchanges two high level message types:
  - DELETE: Indicate to the partner that a session has neen removed.  No
addition HA client status will be exchanged.
  - UPDATE: Indicate all other state changes.  The message always includes
the session state and optionally may include state from other HA clients.
