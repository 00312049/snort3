This module provides miscellaneous utilities related to timing.

* Packet Performance monitoring provides facilities for gathering
  statistics about the packet processing system as a whole.  These
  statistics include timing information for rule evaluation, packet
  decoding and event processing, as well as counts for actions taken on
  packets before and during rule evaluation.

* Performance Profiling provides facilities for evaluating the performance
  of individual preprocessors and rule subtrees.
