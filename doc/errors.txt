FATAL: snort_config is required

* add this line near top of file:

require('snort_config')

PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (cannot open
snort_defaults.lua: No such file or directory)

* export SNORT_LUA_PATH to point to any dofiles

ERROR can't find xyz

* if xyz is the name of a module, make sure you are not assigning a scalar
  where a table is required (eg xyz = 2 should be xyz = { }).

ERROR can't find x.y

* module x does not have a parameter named y.  check --help-module x for
  available parameters.

ERROR invalid x.y = z

* the value z is out of range for x.y.  check --help-config x.y for the range
  allowed.

ERROR: x = { y = z } is in conf but is not being applied

* make sure that x = { } isn't set later because it will override the
  earlier setting.  same for x.y.

FATAL: can't load lua/errors.lua: lua/errors.lua:68: '=' expected near ';'

* this is a syntax error reported by Lua to Snort on line 68 of errors.lua.
