==== Build

* configure bombs on OSX with g++ wrapper to clang because g++ version < 4.8
(compare g++ -dumpversion and g++ --version)

    workaround:  export CXX=clang++

* export CXX=clang++ to build with clang; coughs up these warnings:

    Wunused-but-set-variable is not understood by clang
    clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pthread'

* Cmake doc/ has a problem when SNORT_PLUGIN_PATH is set to get extras
included in the manual.

* Making in doc/ may fail complaining something about xmllint.  Just make
again and it will succeed.  Appears to be an unknown dependency but it
works for me!


==== Config

* Parsing issue with IP lists.  can't parse rules with $EXTERNAL_NET
defined as below because or the space between ! and 10.

    HOME_NET = [[ 10.0.17.0/24 10.0.14.0/24 10.247.0.0/16 10.246.0.0/16 ]]
    EXTERNAL_NET = '! ' .. HOME_NET

* Multiple versions of luajit scripts are not handled correctly.  The
first loaded version will always be executed even though plugin manager
saves the correct version.


==== Rules

* metdata:service foo; metadata:service foo; won't cause a duplicate service
warning as does metadata:service foo, service foo;

* ip_proto doesn't work properly with reassembled packets so it can't be
used to restrict the protocol of service rules.


==== snort2lua

* uricontent:"foo"; content:"bar"; -> http_uri; content:"foo"; content:"bar";
(missing pkt_data)

* stream_tcp ports and protocols both go into a single
binder.when; this is incorrect as the when fields are logically anded
together (ie must all be true).  should create 2 separate bindings.

* There is a bug in pps_stream_tcp.cc.. when stream_tcp: is
specified without any arguments, snort2lua doesn't convert it

* Loses the ip list delimiters [ ]; change to ( )

    in snort.conf: var HOME_NET [A,B,C]
    in snort.lua: HOME_NET = [[A B C]]

* Won't convert packet rules (alert tcp etc.) to service rules (alert http
etc.).
