==== Build

* configure bombs on OSX with g\++ wrapper to clang because g++ version < 4.8
(compare g\++ -dumpversion and g++ --version)

    workaround:  export CXX=clang++

* export CXX=clang++ to build with clang; coughs up these warnings:

    Wunused-but-set-variable is not understood by clang
    clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pthread'

* With cmake, make install will rebuild the docs even though when already
  built.

* IPS option hash and inspectors pop, imap, smtp, and ssl fail to build
  dynamically due to missing symbols in hash/ and protocols/ despite them
  being declared SO_PUBLIC.


==== Config

* Parsing issue with IP lists.  can't parse rules with $EXTERNAL_NET
defined as below because or the space between ! and 10.

    HOME_NET = [[ 10.0.17.0/24 10.0.14.0/24 10.247.0.0/16 10.246.0.0/16 ]]
    EXTERNAL_NET = '! ' .. HOME_NET

* Multiple versions of luajit scripts are not handled correctly.  The
first loaded version will always be executed even though plugin manager
saves the correct version.

* On 32-bit systems, the default snort.lua config will yield:

    ERROR: invalid perf_monitor.max_file_size = 4.29497e+09

* Using -L when -c is also used will not actually log; nor will it warn or
  error out.  This is likely to confuse.


==== Rules

* metdata:service foo; metadata:service foo; won't cause a duplicate service
warning as does metadata:service foo, service foo;

* ip_proto doesn't work properly with reassembled packets so it can't be
used to restrict the protocol of service rules.


==== snort2lua

* uricontent:"foo"; content:"bar"; -> http_uri; content:"foo"; content:"bar";
(missing pkt_data)

* stream_tcp ports and protocols both go into a single binder.when; this is
incorrect as the when fields are logically anded together (ie must all be
true).  should create 2 separate bindings.

* There is a bug in pps_stream_tcp.cc.. when stream_tcp: is
specified without any arguments, snort2lua doesn't convert it

* Loses the ip list delimiters [ ]; change to ( )

    in snort.conf: var HOME_NET [A,B,C]
    in snort.lua: HOME_NET = [[A B C]]

* Won't convert packet rules (alert tcp etc.) to service rules (alert http
etc.).
